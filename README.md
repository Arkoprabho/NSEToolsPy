# Objective

We wish to create a project that will allow retreival of data from the national stock exchange in realtime. This repo aims to be fast and easy to use.


Introduction.
============

NSEToolsPy is a library for collecting real time data from National Stock Exchange (India). It can be used in various types of projects which requires getting live quotes for a given stock or index or build large data sets for further data analytics. You can also build cli applications which can provide you live market details at a blazing fast speeds, much faster that the browsers. The accuracy of data is only as correct as provided on www.nseindia.com.

Main Features:
=============

* Getting live quotes for stocks using stock codes.
* Return data in both json and python dict and list formats.
* Getting quotes for all the indices traded in NSE, e.g CNX NIFTY, BANKNIFTY etc.
* Getting list of top losers.
* Getting list of top gainers.
* Helper APIs to check whether a given stock code or index code is correct.
* Getting list of all indices and stocks.
* Cent percent unittest coverage.

Dependencies
=============
It is advised to use [Anaconda python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) as there is extensive use of pandas along with other libraries.
